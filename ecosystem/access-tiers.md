# Access Tiers

### Tool Access

We are dedicated to eliminating fraud and making scammers' jobs as hard as possible. This is why we are sending out scam alerts on-chain, to make sure we save your hard-earned ETH from these bad actors. Our Smart Contract Scanners (currently available for [ETH](https://t.me/HorusScannerETH), [SOL](https://t.me/HorusScannerSOL), and [BASE](broken-reference)) will always remain free. The rest of the tools are divided into 3 different tiers:

| Tier 1 (100.000+ HORUS) | Tier 2 (200.000+ HORUS)                                                                     | Tier 3 (500.000+ HORUS)                           |

### Token requirement and Subscription-based access

Our users can access tools through Horus token ownership or subscriptions. Ideally, the proportion between token-access and subscription-based users would be 50-50%. The subscription price will be dynamic based on the price of the Horus token to offer a fair balance and incentives rather than buy and hold tokens but a low enough barrier of entry so new users won't be scared away from trying the tools first. If our project reaches, for example, 500 paying users and 500 token-access users, that could easily mean around $20-25k of net income just based on subscriptions, of which 50% will be shared among Tier 2 and Tier 3 holders every month. We honestly believe these are reasonable goals, and the growing user base would be very well reflected on the chart as well.

* Tier 1: Hold 100.000 Horus tokens or pay 1/5 worth for monthly access
* Tier 2: Hold 200.000 Horus tokens or pay 1/4 worth for monthly access
* Tier 3: Hold 500.000 Horus tokens or pay 1/3 worth for monthly access&#x20;

Note that our revenue share program is only available for token holders. Subscription-based users are exempt.
