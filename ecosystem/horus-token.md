# HORUS Token

Our ecosystem is supported by Horus, an ERC20-based token that forms the basis of our platform. With an overall supply of 100 million tokens, Horus provides users with access to premium tools and utilities, enabling them to navigate the crypto landscape. In addition to its function within our ecosystem, Horus allows holders to earn passive income in the form of revenue share derived from our wide variety of revenue sources. As users interact with and contribute toward the growth of our platform, they become active members of an ecosystem where their success is our success, as we pass revenue back to our users on an ongoing basis and unlock additional features reserved for our holders.

### How to buy Horus tokens

To get your Horus tokens, you will need to proceed to a decentralized trading platform, for example, Uniswap or 1inch. Ensure that your wallet is properly connected and contains sufficient ETH/WETH funds to facilitate the purchase. Find our official contract address, which you will then need to copy and paste. It is important to set the slippage to prevent transaction failures (5-6% recommended). Once you have completed these steps, confirm the trade and the Horus tokens will be transferred to your wallet. You might have to manually add the token to your wallet to be able to see them (in Metamask, for example). [You can buy HORUS tokens on Uniswap by clicking here](https://app.uniswap.org/swap?\&chain=mainnet\&use=v2\&outputCurrency=0xf23e25286b7abf0458746c098a847fdba3dd9633).

### Token Supply Allocation

* Total Supply: 100.000.000 (100%)
* Liquidity Pool: 70.000.000 (70%) -> Paired with 2 ETH on launch
* BULL Migration Tokens: 11.000.000 (11%) -> Airdropped to BULL holders
* Unclaimed BULL Migration Tokens: 9.000.000 (9%) -> Burned and out of supply
* Team Funds: 5,000,000 (5%) -> Vested over 12 months and gradually unlocked
* CEX/Marketing: 5,000,000 (5%) -> Vested over 6 months and gradually unlocked

BULL migration tokens are the initial supply allocated for token holders of our previous "identity." Horus used to be called Terrier before rebranding, and that project had a token called BULL to support our first ecosystem. At the time of our rebranding and new token launch, we honored our most patient holders with the option of a 1:1 migration if they filled out the migration form and proved their BULL token ownership. Only 19 previous holders requested this option.

Our only official deployer wallet is [horustools.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcBBF3e25843bbE7c57466438b7832076c6D5438E), but the [scam-alert.horustools.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd5123310eC65Bc7d3E70Ac57c284a3f73EA63ea5) and the [insider-activity.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD54E31903C6c4Ee3E5Dd62db1b48253002F6D5F7) ENS is also part of our ecosystem: one of them sends out automated on-chain scam alerts in case we spot a known scammer acting or a suspicious/preloaded contract, and the other sends on-chain Reversal alerts on previously spotted volume anomaly or insider activity signals.

### Taxes

5% taxes are applied to both buy and sell transactions. The generated funds are used for marketing, infrastructural, staffing, and development purposes, as well as some of them will be used for our automated Treasury trading. and help us to promote our project and ensure that we can continue to develop and improve it over time.
