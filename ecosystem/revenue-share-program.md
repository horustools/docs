# Revenue Share Program

Our ecosystem has to generate stable income to prosper. We are expecting several different revenue streams. These streams include:

1. Horus token buy and sell taxes are currently set at 5%. These funds allow our team to cover infrastructural fees, pay staff salaries, organize marketing efforts, and fund future developments (**15% of the tax income will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
2. 3-tiered subscription-based access to our premium tools with dynamic pricing (**30% of the subscription revenue will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
3. Horus is actively building a Treasury investment fund. The initial funding is based on generated tax income. We then use our safe insider and reversal signals alongside alpha wallet copy-trading to build a sustainable auto-trading model (**30% of the Treasury profits will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
4. Telegram advertisements through our scanners and bots. By allowing project owners to advertise on the bots for a fee, we create an additional revenue stream (coming soon, **30% of ad revenue will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
5. Terminal/Dapp advertisements through banners, search bar highlighting, token page, and wallet explorer page (coming soon, **30% of ad revenue will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
6. API access with data endpoint services for other developers (coming soon, **30% of the API revenue will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
7. Airdrop Farming is a premium feature for automatic multichain airdrop farming. Horus claims a few percent of the collected tokens as a service fee (**coming soon, 50% of the airdrop farm revenue will be distributed through the revenue share program**).
8. Our Auto-trading service gives the opportunity to premium Horus users to streamline their trading activities with customizable configs (sizing, stop-loss, take-profit levels, and other metrics) and provides a Copy-trading option that allows our holders to automatically follow successful wallets (**coming soon, 30% of the trading bot revenue will be distributed through the revenue share program**).

These streams can generate stable, growing income for our ecosystem, which we plan to use for PR and development purposes. To ensure long-term growth for Horus, we are also planning on introducing automated buyback and burn events.
