# History

Horus, formerly known as Clippy (until Jan 2024) and Terrier (until Sept 2024), is a suite of DeFi tools that offers alpha information, research, and analytics to assist users in conducting smarter, faster, and better research. In short, we provide bots and different platforms to help users determine whether a fresh deployment or an older token is worth investing in. As we all know, the cryptocurrency market is highly competitive and fast-moving, and timing and quick decision-making are crucial to success. Therefore, we provide quick, accurate, and in-depth details to our community so that they can make informed decisions and become successful traders.

Our tools include smart contract technical analysis to determine whether a token is secure or not, tokenomics analysis, deployer analysis to investigate a dev's previous successful tokens or rugs, and social analysis to examine a project's statistics on X and Telegram profiles. We can also check key influencers supporting a project and even generate a summary of what that token is all about. We display links to socials of a fresh launch even without their contract being verified so that users can be the first to explore what they have to offer. Our sniper analysis allows users to check how many snipers were involved at launch, their current holdings, and other important details. Users can also check holders' current and all-time PNL.

Let's take a step back to the beginning. We have been on the market since October 2023, originally under the name Clippy. Our first product was our ETH scanner, which our Assistant Bot soon followed. Initially, we did not plan on running a project, as we created these tools to assist our own trading routine and improve our hit rate. However, the scanner quickly gained popularity, and we started seeing new members every day. That's when we realized the need for these tools. As our user base grew, we received feedback on how we could improve and what other features we should implement.  We've grown organically, not just in numbers but also as a project. We started sending out on-chain scam alerts to protect people from potential scams, which accelerated our growth. However, we've also received a few unhappy customers: these bad guys don't like it when we interfere with their business.

In January, we decided to take a more professional approach to branding and communication for our project. We had initially come up with the idea of rebranding from Clippy to Terrier, as we felt that the name was a better fit for the activities we were involved in. The mascot was a bull terrier, which is cute but loyal and fiercely protective of its owners and family. We felt that our values were aligned with those of these amazing creatures: we are always searching for contracts and protecting our community. During the same month, we also launched our SOL scanner amidst the big L1 hype.

In February, we successfully launched the first version of our Decentralized Application (DApp). As we expanded our services, we realized that we had reached the limits of Telegram and needed to develop an online platform. However, the on-chain volume was low, and we've gained little attention throughout 2024, but we kept our tools live for our users.

Things weren't going as expected, but we had no intention to give up. At our lowest, as a last-ditch effort, in September 2024, we've decided to reform our tools, rebrand, and relaunch as Horus. This is where this journey began.
