# Our Team

### Our Mission

Starting in October 2023, our mission at Horus is to arm crypto investors with the tools and knowledge they need to confidently navigate the rapidly shifting DeFi landscape. Our goal is to provide cutting-edge solutions that help our users perform cleverer, quicker, more comprehensive research to help them make better investment decisions. We’ve created a line of DeFi tools, including platforms and bots, that we believe will help to level the playing field and provide our community with a competitive advantage in the crypto marketplace. We believe that solid, thorough information is critical to success in trading crypto, and it’s our mission to provide our users with the information they need to become successful traders and investors.

### Our Vision

At Horus, our vision is to become the single-source solution for cryptocurrency investors in pursuit of alpha information, research, and analytics. We want to make it so that when investors think about how they will get real-time data, smart contract analysis, tokenomics insights, and social analytics – they think of Horus. We promise to continuously innovate and broaden our offering to turn our one-stop shop for all advanced analytics so that our users are on the cutting edge at all times. All of this will be offered with a heavy eye towards transparency, security, and user experience to ensure we are driving a sisterhood and brotherhood of the most informed and equipped investors anywhere in the world.
