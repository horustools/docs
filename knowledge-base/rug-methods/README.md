# Rug Methods

A rug pull is a malicious act in the cryptocurrency world in which developers create and promote a token, attract investors, and then abruptly abandon the project after siphoning off the funds. This type of exit scam is prevalent in decentralized finance (DeFi) and on platforms with limited oversight.

Token rug pulls are a significant risk in the crypto world, especially for beginners drawn to the promise of quick profits. By understanding how these scams operate and taking precautionary measures, you can protect yourself and your investments. Always remember the golden rule of crypto investing: **If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is**.\

Understanding the common rug pull methods and how to identify them is crucial for beginners and even seasoned traders to avoid losses in the fast-paced and often unpredictable crypto space. We at Horus offer several tools that can help you filter out these malicious contracts, so utilizing them correctly can significantly decrease the risk of interacting with them.

### How to protect yourself?

1. **ALWAYS Do Your Own Research (DYOR)**:
   * Research the project’s team, technology, and roadmap. Anonymous teams increase the risk of a rug pull.
   * Avoid projects with vague or overly ambitious promises.
2. **Audit and Code Review**:
   * Invest in tokens with audited smart contracts. Platforms like Horus, CertiK, and Honeypot.is that provides detailed audit reports.
   * Learn to read basic smart contracts or use tools that analyze contract risks.
3. **Monitor Liquidity Locks**:
   * Check if and for how long the project's liquidity is locked. Locked liquidity reduces the risk of the liquidity pool draining.
4. **Token Distribution Analysis**:
   * Investigate token allocation. Beware of projects where the developers hold a large percentage of tokens.
5. **Community Feedback**:
   * Join the project’s social media channels and observe community activity. A genuine project will have a transparent and engaged community.
6. **Stay Cautious with Hype**:
   * Be skeptical of projects that rely heavily on marketing and influencer endorsements without providing substantial technical details or utility.
