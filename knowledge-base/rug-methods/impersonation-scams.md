# Impersonation Scams

Impersonation scams are a widespread problem in the crypto space, particularly on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram. Scammers often pretend to be well-known figures, such as Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin, or popular crypto companies, to trick unsuspecting users into sending them money or sharing sensitive information.

### How do impersonation scams work?

1. **Fake Giveaways**:
   * Scammers set up fake accounts mimicking celebrities or companies.
   * They announce “crypto giveaways,” claiming, for example, “Send 1 BTC to this address, and you’ll get 2 BTC back.”
   * Once you send funds, they vanish—there’s no giveaway.
2. **Phishing Links**:
   * Impersonators share links to fake websites that look like trusted crypto platforms.
   * These fake sites ask for your wallet's private key, seed phrase, or login details. Once you provide these, your funds are stolen.
3. **Fake Announcements**:
   * Scammers use fabricated news about token launches or partnerships and ask users to invest in fake pre-sales.
4. **Direct Messaging Scams**:
   * Impersonators contact you directly, posing as customer support or influencers, offering "assistance" in exchange for payment or access to your wallet.

### How to spot impersonation scams?

1. **Check for Verified Accounts**:
   * Always look for verified badges on social media accounts. However, some platforms have removed strict verification rules, so don’t rely solely on this.
2. **Be Skeptical of Giveaways**:
   * Real influencers and companies rarely ask for funds to participate in giveaways. If they do, verify through their official channels.
3. **Inspect URLs Carefully**:
   * Fake websites often use slight variations of real domain names (e.g., "binancee.com" instead of "binance.com"). Always double-check URLs.
4. **Avoid Clicking Unverified Links**:
   * Never click on random links shared via social media or direct messages, especially those promising quick profits.
5. **Verify Announcements**:
   * Cross-check any major announcements by visiting the official website or trusted news outlets.
6. **Protect Your Information**:
   * Never share your private keys, seed phrases, or wallet passwords with anyone, regardless of who they claim to be.

### Fake partnerships and marketing hype

Another tactic we often see is when project developers claim to have made partnerships with well-established entities, etc. While its not exactly "impersonation", but it is also a method with false claims to lure in unsuspecting investors.

**How It Works**:

* Scammers use aggressive marketing to build hype around a token, often claiming partnerships with big-name companies or influencers.
* Once enough investors are onboarded, the scammers abandon the project.

**How to Spot It**:

* **Verify Claims**: Always double-check partnership announcements with the alleged partner.
* **Reputable News Sources**: Look for news coverage from established crypto outlets, not just project-sponsored press releases.
