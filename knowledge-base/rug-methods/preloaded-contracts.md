# Preloaded Contracts

**How It Works**:

* Preloaded contracts are a deceptive tactic in which scammers hold or send large amounts of tokens to their smart contracts before launch, creating possible risks.&#x20;
* Once investors start buying and the price rises, scammers execute functions to dump the preloaded tokens, crash the price, and steal funds from the liquidity pool.
* It is a relatively easy-to-spot method.

**How to Spot It**:

* **Inspect the Contract**: Use tools like Etherscan or Horus Assistant Bot to analyze the token distribution and identify suspicious activity. Our ETH Scanner and on-chain Scam Alerts are also triggered in case we spot a preloaded contract.
