# Token Minting

**How It Works**:

* Developers embed a backdoor function in the tokenâ€™s smart contract, allowing them to mint an unlimited number of tokens at any time.
* They dump these newly minted tokens on the market, flooding liquidity and collapsing the price.

**How to Spot It**:

* **Audit the Contract:** Analyze the code using tools such as Horus Assistant Bot, EtherScan, or DeFi auditing platforms (e.g., CertiK, and PeckShield).
* **Open-Source Code**: Verify whether the smart contract is public (or verified on EtherScan, etc). Transparency is a sign of a trustworthy project.
