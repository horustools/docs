# Sniper Bots

Crypto sniper bots (e.g., Banana Gun, Maestro, BullX) are automated trading programs designed to execute transactions at extremely high speeds, often faster than human users. These bots are commonly used to gain an advantage in highly competitive scenarios, such as token launches or low-liquidity trading pairs. Sniper bots monitor blockchain networks for specific triggers, such as new liquidity pools or token listings, and act within milliseconds to secure profitable positions before regular traders can react.

### How Do Sniper Bots Work?

1. **Monitoring the Blockchain**:\
   Sniper bots continuously scan the blockchain for events such as token pair creations on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or new contract deployments.
2. **Pre-Configured Criteria**:\
   Bots are programmed to execute trades under specific conditions, such as buying as soon as liquidity is added or when certain price thresholds are met.
3. **Automated Execution**:\
   Once the criteria are met, the bot sends transactions with high gas fees to prioritize their execution, often front-running human traders and other bots.
