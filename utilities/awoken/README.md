# Awoken

Awoken is a utility designed to monitor previously inactive developers and projects. It alerts you the moment they become active againâ€”when they "wake up." This tool provides valuable updates on dormant projects, highlighting renewed activity that could signal significant opportunities. By tracking developers' actions, including specific functions called on their deployers, Awoken makes it easy to uncover potential alpha with minimal effort.

The utility excels at collecting and monitoring all previously deployed projects, ensuring you stay informed when developers who have been inactive suddenly resume their work. This renewed activity could indicate updates, relaunches, or other developments with the potential for substantial growth. Awoken allows you to stay ahead of the curve, keeping track of all your projects and ensuring you never miss out on any emerging opportunities.
