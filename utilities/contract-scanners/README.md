# Contract Scanners

Horus offers swift and accurate analytics channels tailored for in-depth analysis of [Ethereum](https://t.me/HorusScannerETH), [Solana](https://t.me/HorusScannerSOL), and [Base ](https://t.me/HorusScannerBase)tokens. Its comprehensive feature set empowers users to gain valuable insights into a token's smart contract's deployment state (supply, maximum transaction limits, contract balance, taxes, socials if available), including information about the owner wallet (oldest transaction, linked deployments, linked rugs, most successful previous tokens), a track record of similar contracts (rug percentage, Horus Safety Index), and many other metrics enabling data-driven investment decisions.&#x20;
