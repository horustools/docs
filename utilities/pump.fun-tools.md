# Pump.Fun Tools

This tool offers powerful insights into recent Solana launches on Pump.Fun, utilizing advanced monitoring systems to keep you informed about key movements and trends. Features like the Momentum Monitor provide alerts on irregular positive changes in market capitalization categorized by the token's current market cap, helping you identify potential breakout opportunities early.

The Twitter Monitor tracks social media activity and sends alerts when tweets about Pump.Fun launches are detected. These alerts are categorized by the follower count of the accounts involved, ensuring you can gauge the reach and potential impact of the discussion.

Additionally, the King of The Hill (KOTH) Monitor highlights when a token becomes the latest KOTH, giving you an edge in tracking market leaders. It also includes the KOTH Reversal Monitor, which alerts you when an older deployment regains momentum and reclaims the KOTH position, signaling renewed interest and potential for growth.

With this tool, you can stay ahead of market trends, spot opportunities early, and make more informed trading decisions on the Solana network.
