# Scammer Profiling Alerts

One of our most groundbreaking tools was developed with the expertise of a Google specialist in this field. We are creating "fingerprint" maps of developers and administrators for each new project to identify recurring individuals based on personality and behavioral patterns. To address this challenge, weâ€™ve designed unique AI-driven linguistic pattern recognition filters that detect potential scammers through their grammar, writing style, and reused accounts on platforms like X and Telegram. By analyzing chat histories and tweets, our system alerts holders if known scammers are identified, providing an unparalleled layer of protection.
