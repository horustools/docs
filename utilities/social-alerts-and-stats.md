# Social Alerts and Stats

Horus tweets 2 different kinds of messages on the [official account](https://x.com/horustools):

* **Daily ERC20 Scam Reports**: At the end of each day, we provide detailed statistics of deployed Ethereum contracts. This includes how many were launched, how many of them were rugged, and how much ETH was stolen that day.
* **Reversal Alerts**: In case of a successful Reversal signal (meaning at least 2x pump after the message), our bots tweet about that project, tagging the official account and displaying how many percentage of profits our users could make by buying that signal.
