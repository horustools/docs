# Unlaunched

**Unlaunched** is a utility designed to monitor existing ERC20 smart contracts that have yet to be launched. This tool gives users an unparalleled advantage by providing insights into upcoming, sometimes insider projects before they hit the market, making it a valuable resource for staying ahead in the competitive crypto space.

When combined with our Awoken Tool, Unlaunched becomes an essential asset for identifying and tracking potential insider launches. By leveraging the power of both tools, you can gain early access to opportunities, assess the potential of Unlaunched contracts, and make informed decisions well before they are available to the public.
